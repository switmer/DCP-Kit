## Configuration

Create a `dcp.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "registryName": "My Design System",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "componentSource": "./src/components",
  "componentPatterns": ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"],
  "tokens": "./tokens/index.json",
  "output": "./dist/registry.json",
  "llmEnrich": true
}
```

## Project Structure

A typical DCP-Transformer project looks like this:

```
my-design-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tokens/            # Design tokens
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/             # Built registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dcp.config.json   # Configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

## Component Example

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  /** The text content of the button */
  children: React.ReactNode;
  /** Optional variant style */
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

/**
 * Primary button component
 */
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  children,
  variant = 'primary'
}) => {
  return (
    <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Token Example

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": {
      "500": "#0ea5e9"
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "4": "1rem"
  }
}
```

Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a concise, expert-level review and summary of your project based on the codebase, structure, and the issues you‚Äôve encountered:

---

## **Project Overview: DCP-Transformer**

### **Purpose**
DCP-Transformer is a CLI tool and agent for transforming a design system (especially React/TypeScript-based) into a standardized DCP (Design Component Protocol) registry. It automates:
- **Component API extraction** (props, types, docs)
- **Design token extraction and normalization**
- **Schema and documentation generation**
- **Refactoring suggestions** for API and token usage

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Component Analysis:** Parses React components to extract prop types, default values, and doc comments using Babel.
- **Token Management:** Identifies and normalizes design tokens (colors, spacing, etc.).
- **Schema Generation:** Outputs JSON schemas for each component, suitable for documentation or further automation.
- **Refactor Proposals:** Analyzes extracted APIs/tokens and suggests improvements (naming, type safety, token usage).
- **CLI/Agent Workflow:** Can be run as a CLI or as an agent against a codebase, with debug logging for transparency.

### **Project Structure**
- `agent/` ‚Äî Core agent logic and extractors (e.g., `extractors/component.js` for AST parsing)
- `core/`, `commands/` ‚Äî Main transformation and CLI logic
- `schemas/`, `templates/` ‚Äî Output and documentation templates
- `dist/`, `dcp-reports/` ‚Äî Build and report outputs
- `tests/` ‚Äî Test suite (Jest)
- `.storybook/` ‚Äî Storybook config for component docs
- `package.json` ‚Äî Declares dependencies (Babel, Commander, Vite, etc.)

### **Tech Stack**
- **TypeScript** (strict, modern)
- **React** (component analysis)
- **Babel** (`@babel/parser`, `@babel/traverse` for AST)
- **Jest** (testing)
- **Storybook** (component documentation)
- **Vite** (build tool)
- **Commander** (CLI)

### **How It Works**
1. **Run the Agent:**  
   Example:  
   ```bash
   cd agent && node index.js --path /path/to/design-system/src --loglevel debug
   ```
2. **Component Extraction:**  
   - Parses each `.tsx` file, builds an AST, and extracts prop types, default values, and doc comments.
   - Outputs a DCP schema JSON for each component.
3. **Token Extraction:**  
   - Scans for design token usage (colors, spacing, etc.).
   - Normalizes and reports on token usage.
4. **Refactor Suggestions:**  
   - Analyzes extracted APIs/tokens for naming, type, and token usage issues.
   - Outputs markdown-formatted suggestions.
5. **Output:**  
   - DCP registry files in `dcp-registry/components/`
   - Reports and logs for further review

### **Recent Issues & Fixes**
- **Babel Traverse Import:**  
  Fixed import to use `import _traverse from '@babel/traverse'; const traverse = _traverse.default;` for ESM compatibility.
- **Null Checks in Refactor Logic:**  
  Added checks to avoid errors when components lack props or tokens, preventing `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`.

### **Best Practices Observed**
- Modular, testable code
- Modern TypeScript and React patterns
- Automated documentation and schema output
- Linting, type-checking, and test coverage
- Extensible for new extractors or output formats

---

## **Summary**
Your project is a robust, modern tool for design system maintainers. It automates the extraction, normalization, and documentation of component APIs and design tokens, and provides actionable refactor suggestions. The architecture is modular and extensible, following best practices in TypeScript, React, and CLI tooling.

**If you want to improve or extend it further, consider:**
- Adding more extractors (e.g., for CSS-in-JS, stories, or usage examples)
- Improving error reporting and user feedback in the CLI
- Integrating with design tools (e.g., Figma API)
- Enhancing the refactor suggestion engine with more advanced heuristics

If you want a deep dive into any specific part (e.g., how the AST extraction works, how to add new token types, or how to extend the CLI), just let me know!

> Is it testable?

‚è∫ üß™ ABSOLUTELY - But let's make it bulletproof.

  ---
  ‚úÖ Current Test Coverage

  What's Already Testable:
  - ‚úÖ CLI commands run end-to-end without errors
  - ‚úÖ File I/O (extract ‚Üí registry.json ‚Üí transpile ‚Üí components)
  - ‚úÖ Basic validation (schema checks, error handling)

  - üî¥ JSON patch application and rollback
  - üî¥ Schema validation with various inputs
  - üî¥ MCP export format correctness
  - üî¥ Transpiled component correctness
  - üî¥ Error scenarios and recovery

  ---
  üö® Missing Test Infrastructure

  Looking at the earlier Jest issues, we need:
  - Unit tests for each module (extract, transpile, validate)
  - Integration tests for the full pipeline
  - Fixture tests with known good/bad inputs
  - Regression tests to prevent breaking changes
  - Performance benchmarks for large codebases

  ---
  üõ†Ô∏è Let's Ship a Complete Test Suite

  Say the word and I'll build:

  npm test                    # Full test suite
  npm run test:unit          # Individual module tests  
  npm run test:integration   # End-to-end pipeline tests
  npm run test:fixtures      # Known component libraries
  npm run test:performance   # Benchmark large repos

  Test Categories:
  - Parser Tests: Various React/TS component patterns
  - Mutation Tests: JSON patch operations + validation
  - Transpile Tests: Generated component correctness
  - CLI Tests: Command interface + error handling
  - Agent Tests: MCP export + mock LLM responses

  ---
  üìä Why This Matters

  Without comprehensive tests:
  - ‚ùå Can't confidently refactor or add features
  - ‚ùå Risk breaking existing functionality
  - ‚ùå Hard to onboard contributors
  - ‚ùå No benchmark for performance
  - ‚ùå Can't validate agent responses

  With comprehensive tests:
  - ‚úÖ Safe to evolve and extend
  - ‚úÖ Clear API contracts
  - ‚úÖ Regression protection
  - ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
  - ‚úÖ Agent integration validation

  ---
  üöÄ Ready to Ship Test Suite?

  Just say: "Ship comprehensive tests"

  And I'll deliver:
  - Complete Jest test configuration
  - Unit tests for all core modules
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Test fixtures with real components
  - Performance benchmarks
  - CI-ready test pipeline

  You're right - production software needs production tests. Let's make this bulletproof!

  Absolutely, Steve. Here‚Äôs how you anchor this in **real, tangible use cases**‚Äî*not* just the features, but exactly what teams and products do with ‚ÄúCRISPR for Code‚Äù that they couldn‚Äôt do before. I‚Äôll break it down for your product page, pitch, or sales deck:

---

## **Real-World Use Cases for CRISPR for Code**

---

### 1. **Safe Design Token Rollouts Across a Codebase**

> **Problem:**
> Rebranding or updating design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) is risky‚Äîtouches hundreds of files, often breaks layouts, and takes weeks.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* Run:

  ```bash
  npx dcp agent "Update all primary buttons to use color.brand.accent"
  ```
* *System generates mutation patch, previews every change, and applies instantly with rollback support.*

> **Outcome:**

* Rebrand entire design system in minutes, not months
* No side effects, no missed edge cases, fully auditable

---

### 2. **Batch Deprecation and Prop Migrations**

> **Problem:**
> Deprecating an old prop (`size="large"`) or moving to a new API (`<Button iconLeft>` to `<Button startIcon>`) requires risky, manual refactor scripts‚Äîcan break features and slow delivery.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* Run:

  ```bash
  npx dcp agent "Replace all uses of iconLeft with startIcon in Button components"
  ```
* *Patch is previewed, validated, and only safe mutations land. Undo if needed.*

> **Outcome:**

* Product migrations in seconds‚Äîno refactor debt, no product outages

---

### 3. **Design System Scaling and Enforcement**

> **Problem:**
> Design systems drift‚Äîteams fork, customize, and break standards.
> Central enforcement is hard and slow.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* Run:

  ```bash
  npx dcp agent "Make sure all Card components use shadow level 2"
  ```
* *Enforces design consistency everywhere, tracks and logs every enforced mutation.*

> **Outcome:**

* Uniform, compliant design across products‚Äî*with audit trail*

---

### 4. **AI Agent-Driven Continuous Evolution**

> **Problem:**
> No safe way for AI agents to make codebase changes at scale.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* AI can analyze MCP, propose mutation plans, and submit for approval.
* Every agent mutation is schema-checked, previewed, and reversible.

> **Outcome:**

* Agents continuously improve accessibility, refactor for performance, or enforce standards‚Äî*without breaking things*.

---

### 5. **Instant Undo of Risky Changes**

> **Problem:**
> Mass updates gone wrong are hard to roll back. Git reverts are clumsy.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* Run:

  ```bash
  npx dcp rollback --to last
  ```
* *Instantly reverts to previous, known-good state.*

> **Outcome:**

* Teams can take bold action knowing they‚Äôre always one command from safety.

---

### 6. **Interactive Visual Approval and Auditing**

> **Problem:**
> Refactor scripts run ‚Äúin the dark‚Äù‚Äîno way to see the real scope or risk before applying.

> **With CRISPR for Code:**

* Visual diff preview‚Äîshows before/after at the component or system level
* Risk assessment and change log before you approve

> **Outcome:**

* Decisions made with eyes open‚Äîevery stakeholder can review, approve, and track change
